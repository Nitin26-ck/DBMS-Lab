Consider the relations BOAT, SAILOR and RESERVES. The relation BOAT identifies the features of a boat such as unique identifier, color and a name.
The list of sailors with attributes such as SailorID, name, age etc., are stored in the relation Sailor.
The sailors are allowed to reserve any number of boats on any day of the week.

Create the tables, insert suitable tuples and perform the following operations in SQL:

//CREATING TABLES

CREATE TABLE Boat(
BID	VARCHAR(3),
Bname	VARCHAR(10),
Colour	VARCHAR(6),
PRIMARY KEY (BID)
);

CREATE TABLE Sailor(
SID	VARCHAR(3),
Sname	VARCHAR(10),
Age	NUMBER(2),
PRIMARY KEY (SID)
);

CREATE TABLE Reserves(
BID	VARCHAR(3),
SID	VARCHAR(3),
Day	VARCHAR(8),
PRIMARY KEY (BID,SID),
FOREIGN KEY (BID) REFERENCES Boat(BID),
FOREIGN KEY(SID) REFERNCES Sailor(SID)
);

//INSERTING THE VALUES

INSERT INTO Boat VALUES('B1','Fisher','Red');
INSERT INTO Boat VALUES('B2','Whale','Yellow');
INSERT INTO Boat VALUES('B3','Indian','Green');
INSERT INTO Boat VALUES('B4','Seal','Red');
INSERT INTO Boat VALUES('B5','Fisher','Blue');

INSERT INTO Sailor VALUES('S1','Sam',40);
INSERT INTO Sailor VALUES('S2','Ricky',30);
INSERT INTO Sailor VALUES('S3','Sami',45);
INSERT INTO Sailor VALUES('S4','Ram',40);
INSERT INTO Sailor VALUES('S5','Sejal',25);

INSERT INTO Reserves VALUES('B1','S1','Friday');
INSERT INTO Reserves VALUES('B3','S4','Tuesday');
INSERT INTO Reserves VALUES('B2','S3','Saturday');
INSERT INTO Reserves VALUES('B5','S1','Sunday');
INSERT INTO Reserves VALUES('B2','S2','Friday');

//SQL QUERRIES

1. Obtain the bid of the boats reserved by ‘#Sailor_Name’. 
	SELECT BID
	FROM Reserves
	WHERE SID IN (SELECT SID
	              FROM Sailor
	              WHERE Sname='Sami');
		      
2. Retrieve the bid of the boats reserved by all the sailors.
	SELECT BID
	FROM Boat B
	WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT S.SID 
	 	          FROM Sailor S
		          WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT R.SID
					     FROM Reserves R
					      WHERE R.BID= B.BID
					       	    AND R.SID= S.SID));
						    
3. Find the number of boats reserved by each sailor 
	SELECT COUNT(BID),SID
	FROM Reserves 
	GROUP BY SID;
